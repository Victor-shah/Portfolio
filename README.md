# 02 Instagram User Analytics
• While analysing the tables we were able to figure out the oldest customers
of the Instagram app. For these customers to remain with the application
the best way would gift them perks.
• The identification of bot and fake accounts will help in removal of these
accounts to improve security and privacy within the application.
• We were able to understand how different users engage with the Instagram
app.
• The Identification of the most popular content and trends such as hashtags.
• Targeted ad campaigns to different user groups based on their engagement in the application.
